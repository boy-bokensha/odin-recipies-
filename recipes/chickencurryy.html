<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Heat 2 very large, deep skillets. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil to each. Season the chicken pieces with salt </p>
    <p>and add half of them to each skillet. Cook over high heat until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.</p>
    <p>Transfer the chicken pieces to a large bowl. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillets along</p>
    <p> with the jalapeños and dried red chiles. Cook over moderately high heat until sizzling, about 30 seconds. </p>
    <p> Divide the onions, garlic and ginger between the skillets and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep brown, </p>
 <p>about 8 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>
    <p>Spoon the onion mixture into a food processor. Add the coriander, cumin, fenugreek seeds, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, </p>
     <p> paprika and 1 teaspoon of salt and puree. Transfer half of the onion mixture to each of the skillets. Add the tomatoes </p>
     <p>and chopped cilantro to the food processor and puree.</p></li>
     <li>
         <p>
            Return the chicken pieces to the skillets along with any accumulated juices. Cook over moderate heat, stirring, </p>
            <p>until the onion sauce begins to stick to the skillets, about 8 minutes. Stir half of the yogurt into each skillet, </p>
                <p>then stir in the pureed tomato and cilantro. Simmer the curry over moderately low heat, turning the chicken pieces occasionally, </p> 
                    <p>until cooked through, about 50 minutes; add 1/4 cup of water to each skillet towards the end of cooking if the sauce gets too thick. </p> 
                        <p>Season the curry with salt and transfer the chicken to a platter. Pour the sauce on top, sprinkle with garam masala and the cilantro leaves and serve. </p>
